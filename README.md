# Budgeting App

The Budgeting App is a simple application that allows users to track their income, expenses, and manage their personal finances. The app starts as a static frontend built with HTML/CSS and evolves into a full-stack project with a Node.js backend.

## Current Features:
- Add income and expenses via a simple input form
- Display financial transactions in a list format
- Categorize income and expenses (e.g., Food, Rent, Entertainment)
- View total balance, income, and expense summaries
- Set budget goals and track spending against them

## Tech Stack:
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: To manage financial transactions and user interaction
- **Node.js/Express**: (Upcoming) For backend API
- **MongoDB**: (Upcoming) To store income and expense data in a database

## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertusdixit/Budgeting-App.git


TO DO LIST
Initialize package.json with npm init and install basic dependencies.
Implement backend API with Node.js/Express.
Connect the app to MongoDB for data persistence.
